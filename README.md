# Flight-Data-Analysis
Our analysis and visualization techniques are geared towards helping the reader
effortlessly acquire interpretations needed to make appropriate and accurate
conclusions with regards to flight information among the states of the United State of
America in 2009. To achieve our aim, we posed 3 questions:
I. What are the days and dates for which the flight are cancelled or diverted
the most and what are the ratio of different cancellation code?
II. Which is the most travelled air carrier by the state and which is the top
carrier by passenger count?
III. What is the flight combines arrival and departure delays (in hours) for
each state?
IV. What are the days and dates preferences of the travelers

<br>
What are the days and dates for which the flights are cancelled or diverted the
most and what is the ratio of different cancellation codes?
Here is the below representation we can see that.
1) Most cancellation (3670) was done on Saturday, whereas most of the flights (309) were
diverted on Monday for December 2009.
2) Most cancellation (2534) was done on 19 December 2009, where most of the flights (150)
are were diverted on 14 December 2009.
3) There are 4 cancellation types, which can be seen in graph
a. Type A contributes 23% of total cancellations done.
b. Type B contributes 66.5% of total cancellations done.
c. Type C contributes 10.5% of total cancellations done.
d. Type D contributes 0.0883% of total cancellations done

Which is the most travelled air carrier by the state and which is the top carrier
by passenger count?
Below is the graph related to the air carrier
Fig1: It is a Pie chart representing the control over the travel population of the USA by the air carrier. As
can be seen in the below graph 17.6% of total travelers travel with WN air carrier and then by OO air
carrier with 8.81% of total travellers in the USA for DEC 2009.
Fig2: It is a 3D-Scatter plot showing the preference of travelers of each air carrier in each state. 
Their preference is calculated in the percentage of total travel by that air carrier in that specific state.
Fig 3: It is a Choropleth graph displaying the most preferred air carrier in that state using the hover data.
As seen in the screen print, for the state of Colorado the most preferred air carrier is ‘OO’ and 27.18% of
total travel is done by OO air carrier in Colorado

What is the flight combined arrival and departure delays (in hours) for each state?
The below graph represents the total delay(arrival delay / Departure delay) of the flights in a state. The
Arrival or delay time is the sum of all the arrival or departure delays by all the carriers in a state and
that time is then converted to hours.
Here in the below graph, we can see that Texas is the state with the most delay in the arrival time
(10650.75 Hours) and also in the departure time (13012.85 Hours) combined of all the carriers

Here below is the 3D subplot graph showing the arrival and departure delay for each carrier in each US
state for Dec 2009.

From the graph, we can see that most arrival delays by a carrier in a state were by AA in Texas of
158907 minutes in Dec 2009.

From the graph, we can see that most departure delays by a carrier in a state were by WN in California
state of 260419 minutes in Dec 2009.

What are the days and date preferences of the travellers?
The below graph represents the Days and dates preferences of the traveller for December 2019.
From the below graph, we can see that in the US the most preferred day of the week to travel is Wednesday
and the most preferred date of travel was 28.
As per the data,
There 86481 passengers preferred travelling on Wednesday which is the most for a day of the week,
whereas 56567 passengers preferred Saturday which is the minimum for a day of the week.
For the date of the month, 21 Dec 2009 has the most travel of 17951 passengers on a day whereas the
minimum was for 19 Dec 2009, 13383 passengers travelled on that day.
